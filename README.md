# Codenation Data Science Challenge

## Introduction 

Our goal in this challenge is to create a model in the train.csv file to predict the math test score (column NU_NOTA_MT) of those who participated in ENEM 2016.
Then we will have to save the answer in a file called answer.csv with two columns: NU_INSCRICAO and NU_NOTA_MT.
